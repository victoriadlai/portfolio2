				<h3>YUMMI ONBOARDING</h3>
				<p>Yummi is a platform where users are encouraged to log their "food prints". The app acts as a food diary that can be shared with followers. Project was focused around revamping the onboarding screens for users to instill a strong value proposition that separates the application from social media. Research regarding new users' interpretation of the application was conducted, and a new feature-walkthrough onboarding process was adopted and prototyped to highlight key features that set the application aside from any other.</p>

				<h3>AUTISM AWARENESS</h3>
				<p>There exists a negative stigma that surrounds those with autism. This project focuses on eliminating this stigma by placing those without autism in the shoes of those who do. Facebook was selected as the platform to house this campaign due to its large audience and how frequently it is used in a given day. Instead of simply throwing facts around, this campaign is designed to immerse the user in activities that reflect activities done by those with autsim in the day-to-day.  </p>
