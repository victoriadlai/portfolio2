				<h3>USER INTERVIEWS</h3>
				<p>User interviews are crucial in determining the types of users who will be using your product and their goals, expectations, and pain points they might have towards the type of product you are trying to provide. The types of questions asked during user interviews for this portfolio website touched upon the user’s role, their mental models of products similar to the one that is being designed, preferences regarding specific features, expectations of the website’s functionality and content, and concerns.</p>

				<h3>COMPETITOR ANALYSIS</h3>
				<p>A competitor analysis is a form of research in which the designer identifies and analyzes competitor products in order to identify strengths and weaknesses that can be drawn upon when the designer produces his/her own competing product. For this portfolio website, the competitors that were reviewed were portfolio websites of other UI/UX designers, websites of design agencies that provide UI/UX services, and websites that already serve as a platform to showcase skills and experiences. Other portfolio websites and design agency websites were reviewed to identify what those in my field identify as crucial or convincing information to provide to potential clients. Platforms that provide a place for users to showcase skills and experiences were reviewed in order to identify how these platforms present information concisely and what they have identified are important details to share with recruiters.</p>

				<h3>FEATURE VALUE MATRIX</h3>
				<p>A feature value matrix is an artifact that requires designers to essentially calculate the degree of importance each feature holds for the product and business. The features that are being compared are extracted from user interviews and the competitor analysis. </p>

				<h3>FEATURE PRIORITIZATION</h3>
				<p>After calculating the degree of importance of each feature in relation to the product and business in the feature value matrix, the features could be prioritized in terms of importance when it comes to completing the product. In other words, when building the interface for a product, features with higher priority should be emphasized as the “essence” of the product. In the event that the designer runs out of time, the features with lower priority should be the features that are scraped.</p>

				<h3>USER STORIES</h3>
				<p>User stories are essentially descriptions of users’ goals, motivations, and actual process of navigating through the features of a product. The user stories created for this portfolio website drew upon the motivations of users identified during the user research phase of this project. </p>

				<h3>COGNITIVE WALKTHROUGH</h3>
				<p>A cognitive walkthrough is a test performed where users complete tasks using the interface of a product and are asked accompanying questions to test the learnability and usability of the product. One of the biggest challenges faced was accounting for different preferences between users. For example, some users preferred my minimalistic approach, while others thought it was too simple.</p>

				<h3>USER TEST</h3>
				<p>For my user tests, I conducted a five second test, a click test, and a navigation test. The five second test was meant to test what users were able to learn about the website and/or me at first glance. This test revealed that the first impression I made with my website’s homepage is concise and simple to understand. The purpose of the click test is to identify what area of the website users gravitate to in order to find information about my skills and work experience. This test revealed that most test subjects had the tendency to find information about my professional experience on my resume. I conducted a navigation test to determine if there was any other location users expected to find my contact information on the website. The results showed that some test subjects wanted to see my contact information in the About Me section of my website. Perhaps the biggest challenge faced in conducting these tests were the test subjects’ tendencies to ignore the instructions provided at the beginning of the test. As a result, many users took the test blindly and did not understand what they needed to do.</p>

			<h1>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
			<div class="description">
				<p>After conducting user research I was able to compile a basic blueprint for the content and the interactions of my portfolio website. The user interviews helped me to identify the types of users who would be viewing my website, their goals and motivations in doing so, the professional and personality details they expect to see, and what their ideal vision is for a usable interface. The competitor analysis confirmed findings in user interviews and also showed me how other UI/UX designers made their websites unique to themselves in order to reflect their personality. The feature value matrix and feature prioritization ensured that features holding the most priority were designed first and the least were designed last.</p>
				<p>After completing the first version of my website, conducting user testing helped me to identify any pain points as well as details that should be addressed in future iterations of my website. The user stories helped me to ensure that the website provided content in a clear and concise way, so that my audience achieved their goals or satisfied their motivations as efficiently as possible. The cognitive walkthrough helped me to address areas on my website where there is a lack of detail or where the functionality or purpose of certain features was unclear. Many users came to the conclusion that I needed to provide additional contact information, such as links to other social media accounts, and reveal more of my personality outside of the field. User tests provided insight on users’ impulsive behaviors and how the usability of the website accounted for that.</p>

			<div class="description">
				<p><b>Contact Section:</b></p>
				<p>Added link to LinkedIn profile for additional professional insight</p>
				<p>Added link to Instagram profile for additional personality insight</p>
				<p>Replaced contact section and provided contact information in footer of the page instead.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Navigation:</b></p>
				<p>Navigation was not jumping to the correct tags, so attempted to use other jQuery and JavaScript codes for anchor scrolling; however, each produced the same results, if not worse.<p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Resume:</b></p>
				<p>Embedded in a separate page of the website, instead of simply linked to a PDF. </p>
				<p>Added navigation to the Resume page so that users can easily navigate back to the website.</p>
				<p>TO DO - Add media queries to the CSS for the Resume page.<p>
				<br>
				<p><b>About Me Section:</b></p>
				<p>TO DO - Condense professional description about me.</p>
				<p>TO DO - Present information regarding my interests and personality outside of<p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Projects Section:</b></p>
				<p>TO DO - Add links to separate page of the website that holds a full-blown case study of my projects. The challenge has been identifying how much detail is too much or too little when it comes to case studies.<p>
